The Watchers, also known as the Frozen Watchers or the Pierce-Eyes, are ancient beings of [[The Void]] and the masters above all living Voidborns, as well as creators of the prototype models of the modern ones. They existed long before any of the physical realm, with the creation of the physical realm waking them from their eternal slumber in nothingness. They are responsible for transforming [[Freljord]] native beings into [[Iceborn]], who would later rebel against The Watchers' rule. In the mostly forgotten myth, the [[Howling Abyss]] was built to contain The Watchers by [[Ornn]] at the request of the [[Three Sisters|Three Iceborn Sisters]].

The Watchers want nothing more than to extinguish the light and sound of the physical realm and return the universe to a state of nothingness once again.
