The Vastaya are a chimeric race of [[Runeterra]] that are the weaker magical descendants from enlightened mortals that took the power of the spirit realm into themselves known as the [[Vastayashai’rei]]. From the ferocious, bestial power of Rengar to the foxlike allure of Ahri, vastaya can look considerably different from one another, but they all share animal and human characteristics.
