The word Undead is an umbrella term that refers to entities comprised of either a solitary soul or a fusion of souls originating from one or several mortal species and are tethered to the physical realm through physical or magical medium.

An example of a physical medium would be a body or an armor. Mordekaiser was able to resurrect by being bound to an armor piece.

A magical-natured medium example would be the raiths bound to the Black Mist. They are not able to leave the Shadow Isles on their own. Only when the Harrowing starts and the Mist creeps towards Bilgewater are they able to go beyond the shores of the Isles.
