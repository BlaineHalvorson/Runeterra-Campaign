The Spirit Realm, or Spirit World, is a parallel pocket of existence to the physical realm, both of which make up the realm of existence of [[Runeterra]]. It is the home and origin place of the [[Spirits]]. While most (if not all) [[Spirits|spirits]] seem to cross easily to the physical realm, mortals can only visit the spirit realm while in death or having powerful Spiritual Prowess.

Very little is known about the spirit world, usually through tales and myths. What it is known is that a place where time and space function differently from the physical realm. The Spirit World seems to be separated by smaller regions or "realms".
