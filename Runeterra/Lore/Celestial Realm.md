The Celestial Realm, or the Realm of Creation, is all of space and time and their contents, including planets (such as the physical and [[Spiritual Realm|Spirit Realms]] which make up the realm of  [[Runeterra]]), stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. Very little is known about the cosmos, usually through tales, myths, and general observation. What is known is that it is a place where time and space function differently from the realm of [[Runeterra]]. Beyond it (or seemingly below it) is the [[The Void]], the Realm of Nothingness.
