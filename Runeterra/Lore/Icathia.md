Icathia is a lost city bordering [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurima]] in the southeast part of the Southern Continent. During their rebellion against [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurima]], upon being deceived by promises whispered by the [[Watchers]], they opened a [[The Void|Void Rift]] in an attempt to fight back against [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurima’s]] [[God-Warriors]]. The [[Voidborn]] that emerged from this rift fought against the [[God-Warriors]] in what would be known as the [[Void War]]. Today Icathia remains a barren wasteland of [[The Void|the void’s]] corruption.
