The Rune Wars were historical wars where the mortals of [[Runeterra]] used the [[World Runes]] to fight each other. These wars were so brutal that they erased multiple civilizations, landmasses, and much of the recorded history from the face of the planet, leaving behind only myths and folklore. [[Runeterra]] deteriorates in civilizational decline, as the majority of its inhabitants are plunged back into a simpler, more primitive way of life.
