The umbrella term Ascended refers to all [[Humans]] who were magically altered by a variety of magic, chiefly celestial magic. After their ascension, the Ascended can channel celestial magic through their connection to [[Celestials|Celestial entities]], but do not "gain" celestial magic themselves.

There are a few notable types of Ascended:

- [[Aspect Hosts]] are [[Targon|Targonian]] ascended and mostly a melding of a Human and [[Targon]] celestial known as an [[Aspects|Aspect]], which primarily retain their human appearance.
- The [[God-Warriors]], known also as the Sunborn, are [[Shurima (Nation)|Shuriman]] ascended magically altered by The [[The Sun Disc]] of [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurima]] using the stolen knowledge of Aurelion Sol and the sun's power, their common form is that of anthropomorphised animals, however they are able to take any form they wish during ascension.
    - [[Baccai]] are [[Shurima (Nation)|Shuriman]] ascended who failed to fully ascend, where as [[Darkin]] are [[Shurima (Nation)|Shuriman]] ascended who drastically altered their bodies with hemomancy. Currently, most [[Darkin]] are trapped in weapons, but morph their hosts into an approximation of their original [[Darkin]] forms.
