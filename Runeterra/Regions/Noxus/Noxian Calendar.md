The [[Noxus]] calendar is separated into 10 months with 30 days in each month. Being the calendar of [[Noxus]], the calendar is based around war time seasons and was redesigned for efficiency over traditions of previous calendars, most notably the [[Shurima (Nation)|Shuriman]] calendar from which this was built on top of.
