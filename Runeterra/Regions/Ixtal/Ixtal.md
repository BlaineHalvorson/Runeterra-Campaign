Secluded deep in the wilderness of eastern [[Shurima (Continent)|Shurima]], the sophisticated arcology-city of [[Ixaocan]] remains mostly free of outside influence. Having witnessed from afar the ruination of the [[Blessed Isles]], and the softening of Buhru culture, the Ixtali view the other factions of [[Runeterra]] as little more than upstarts and pretenders, and use their powerful elemental magic to keep any intruders at bay.
