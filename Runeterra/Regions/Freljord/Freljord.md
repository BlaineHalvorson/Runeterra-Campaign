The Freljord is a harsh and unforgiving land, where [[Spirit Gods|demi-gods]] walk the earth and the people are born warriors. While there are many individual tribes, the three greatest are the [[Avarosans]], the [[Winter's Claw]], and the [[Frostguard]], each uniquely shaped by their will to survive. It is also the only place on [[Runeterra]] where [[True Ice]] can be found.
