Sejuani was born of a [[Freljord]] political marrige, daughter of the Warmother of the [[Winter's Claw]] Kalkia. But her mother would quickly abandon the role of Warmother, instead pursuing another man she had her eyes on, leaving the tribe in chaos. Instead, Sejuani was raised by her Grandmother Heijan, a cold and uncaring mother figure who's expectations Sejuani could never seem to meet.
