The Spirit Gods are a race of powerful [[spirits]] who represent whole cultures, ideas and civilizations. Their strength depends on the amount of people worshipping them. They exist in multiple locations and have multiple depictions depending on where they are worshipped.

Sprit Gods and Demi-gods are the same beings, just different names based on cultures.
