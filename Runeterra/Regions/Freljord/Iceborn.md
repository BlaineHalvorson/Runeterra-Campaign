Iceborn is a rare magical alteration that makes the individual more resistant to the cold and grants them the ability to manipulate both [[True Ice]] and [[Dark Ice]]. It is the result of an ancient and terrible bargain made by  [[Lissandra]] to grant those powers for her sisters and followers. The vast majority of known Iceborn are [[Humans|humans]], though the [[Three Sisters]] had Iceborn followers from different races.
