Demacia is a proud, lawful kingdom with a prestigious military history. Founded as a refuge from magic after the [[Rune Wars]], some might suggest that the golden age of Demacia has passed, unless it proves able to adapt to a changing world. Self-sufficient and agrarian, its society is inherently defensive and insular, valuing justice, honor, and duty above all else.
