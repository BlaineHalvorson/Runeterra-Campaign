The Sun Disc is a megastructure built in the center of the [[Shurima (Continent)|Shuriman Continent]] and functions as the ancient and modern capital of [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurima]]. Built with the aid of [[Mount Targon]] and [[Ixtal]], the Sun Disc is the primary mechanism for the creation of the [[God-Warriors]]. Damaged during [[Xerath|Xerath’s]] ascension, it has sat buried in the sands of Shurima since.
