Xerath began as a brilliant but bitter [[Shurima (Nation)|Shuriman]] slave who clawed his way into forbidden scholarship alongside his friend [[Azir]], eventually becoming the young prince’s closest advisor. Consumed by a hunger to escape the chains of his birth, he steered [[Azir]] toward ascending [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurima’s ]]empire—then betrayed him during the ritual, seizing the godlike power for himself. The explosion of stolen [[Ascended|Ascention]] obliterated the capital and hurled Xerath’s unstable, newly-forged arcane form into a sarcophagus beneath the ruins. Today he remained entombed, eternally battling Renekton and raging in the dark, a living storm of magic.
