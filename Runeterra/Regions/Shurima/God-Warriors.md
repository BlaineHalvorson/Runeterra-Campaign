The God-warriors, also known as the Sunborn, were once Shuriman ascended who underwent a transformative ritual to give them extraordinary power and long life so they could safeguard their nation and its interests. It was said that entire campaigns could be won the moment a god-warrior took to the field because their foes chose to turn and flee rather than face them directly. Ascension is a ritual usually decided upon by the Sun Priests (clerics of sun worship) through mystical criteria governed by ritual and superstition. It is usually granted to those who have selflessly served Shurima, giving them the chance to do so even after what would normally be their time to die. While few of them remain, they are still some of the strongest beings on [[Runeterra]]. Other versions of the Shuriman ascended are [[Baccai]], and the [[Darkin]].

As an Ascended is created, a celestial concept merges with their mortal body and grants them ascended power. If an Ascended is trapped or removed from reality, the celestial concept connected to them will also be trapped or simply cease to exist.
