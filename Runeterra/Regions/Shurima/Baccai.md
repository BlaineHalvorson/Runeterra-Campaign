The Baccai were once ordinary [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurimans]] reshaped through ancient [[Ascended]] experiments, their bodies twisted by alchemical grafts, animal essences, and half-understood magic meant to imitate true [[Ascended|Ascention]]. Unlike the noble [[God-Warriors]], the Baccai were unstable, often suffering warped minds, shortened lifespans, or violent instincts. Still, they served as shock troops, guardians, and occasionally political weapons of the [[Shurima (Nation)|Shuriman]] empire. Today, with [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurima]] long collapsed, most surviving Baccai had devolved into scattered, feral remnants or isolated, long-lived anomalies lurking in the deep deserts, remembered more as cautionary tales of hubris than as people.
