The mercantile clans of [[Piltover]] each have their own unique sigil to identify their homes, workshops, shipments, warehouses, inventions, brands and places of business. Each sigil bears many meanings and interpretations; some obvious, some less so.

Among the [[Great Houses|leading families]] of Piltover, it is customary for one of the younger children to take up the mantle of the family's [[Principal Intelligencer]], the sword and shield of their clan. 

The difference between a clan and a house is that clans are larger, do not necessarily have all of their members related by blood by direct family connections, and have larger political influence and income for their ventures.
