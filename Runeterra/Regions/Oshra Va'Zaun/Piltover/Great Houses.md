The great houses of [[Piltover]] represent the city’s oldest and most respected lineages, families whose names carry weight across academies, council chambers, and social spheres. Each house maintains its own heraldic crest, used to mark estates, correspondence, formal attire, academic sponsorships, and civic contributions. These crests often incorporate symbols tied to the family’s history, virtues, or long-held traditions, with layered meanings both ceremonial and practical.

Among the prominent families of [[Piltover]], it is customary for heirs to be groomed not only in commerce and scholarship, but in public service, diplomacy, and the maintenance of social order. Members of the great houses are expected to uphold the ideals of [[Piltover|Piltover’s]] meritocracy, sponsor educational or infrastructural pursuits, and act as stabilizing forces in the city’s political landscape. Furthermore, many of the great houses will assign one of their heirs as the house’s [[Principal Intelligencer]], tasked with working along side [[Merchant clans|merchant clan]] leaders to ensure the continued success of the family.

The distinction between a great house and a [[Merchant clans|merchant clan]] lies in their foundations:
great houses are built on lineage, reputation, and generational prestige, while [[Merchant clans|merchant clans]] rise through industrial strength, wealth accumulation, and wide organizational networks. Houses may influence the economy, but their authority stems primarily from heritage and governance rather than the broad commercial enterprises that define the mercantile clans.
