Piltover is a thriving, progressive city overlooking the ocean. It is positioned on the isthmus between [[Valoran]] and [[Shurima (Continent)|Shurima]], allowing it to be a shipping city with access to both the east and west oceans and ships goods from all over the world. [[Merchant clans]] and [[Great Houses]] fund incredible endeavors, including artistic follies and architectural monuments to their individual power.
