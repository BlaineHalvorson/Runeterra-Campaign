The “Blessed Isles” are little more than a drifting legend—an island chain somewhere far across the eastern waters, spoken of by sailors and spice merchants who swear the sea hides a land untouched by drought, plague, or war. [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurimans]] storytellers claim the people there wield healing arts so refined that even dying men can be restored, and that their priests guard waters infused with the favor of forgotten spirits. No one in the empire truly knows their customs or rulers; the Isles stay hidden behind strange sea-mists, opening only to travelers they choose. To most [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurimans]] today, the Blessed Isles are a half-mythical paradise: a place that might exist, might not, and definitely isn’t interested in being found.
