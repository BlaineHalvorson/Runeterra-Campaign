A mountainous and sparsely inhabited region to the west of [[Shurima (Nation)|Shurima]], Targon boasts the tallest peak in [[Runeterra]]. Located far from civilization, [[Mount Targon]] is all but impossible to reach, save by the most determined pilgrims, chasing some soul-deep yearning to reach its summit. Those hardy few who survive the climb return haunted and empty, or changed beyond all recognition.
