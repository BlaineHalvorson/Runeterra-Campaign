General description:
- 18 years old
- Forge Cleric
- Physically quite strong
- Worships [[Ornn]]
- [[Brightstone Family|Her family]] is of repute, however she is looked down on for being a disappointment after her involvement in a big accident
- Is ashamed of her past and wants to live up to [[Brightstone Family|family's]] expectation
- Works in the mines now
- Is living through a crisis of faith, thinks that [[Ornn]] should grant her the ability to live up to expectations or has she been outcast by him after the accident as well?
- Insecure about coming from the North, feels like a fish out of water in the mines even though she is capable here

**Central Struggle**
- "Building confidence in herself, learning to stand up despite her failures, learning what really happened the night of the accident, and accepting that her family was at fault, not her, and that her worth is found from within, not outside."

**Plot point ideas**
- Final act:
	- She must decide between 
		- following her faith in [[Ornn]] (follows the signs of [[Ornn]] and discovers a secret area that allows her greater control over the explosion and grants her insight into the true cause of things going wrong)
			- She dies in the explosion but is able to delay it long enough for everyone to make it out alive. She is reforged by [[Ornn]], coming back to life bearing markings of [[Ornn]] and granting her powers
		- following her faith in herself (do what she thinks is right)
			- She is able to delay the explosion long enough for most people to escape. She narrowly escapes the explosion with her life but she is remembered and honored as a great smith that saved many lives
		- following her urge to live up to others expectations (do what someone else tell her)
			- She is unable to save very many people. She is outcast fully by her [[Brightstone Family|family]] and people she admires. She ends up going to live in what is now [[Zaun]] and work in the fissures away from people. Her story will continue and she must deal with the consequences here and pick herself up and redeem herself.
